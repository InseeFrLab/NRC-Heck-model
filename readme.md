# NRC Heck model

## What is it ?

The program NRC-Heck-model simulates a general population of individuals, whose income is generated at random.  
A binary response status is generated according to a law depending on the previous income.  
This allows to study the behaviour of Non Missing-At-Random (NMAR) Horvitz-Thompson estimates, 
as well as various estimates corrected for non-response, based on Heckman's models.

The program NRC-Heck-model is the companion of the article:

L. Castell and P. Sillard (2021): Le traitement du biais de sélection endogène dans les enquêtes auprès des ménages par modèle de Heckman, document de travail de la DMCSI N°, INSEE

It reproduces the results reported in Annex C of this article.
